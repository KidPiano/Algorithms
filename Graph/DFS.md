Note: this page talks about Depth-First Search (DFS) for graphs, as described in [CLRS](https://kidpiano.github.io/Algorithms/CLRS.html){:target="_blank"}.

Depth-First Search (DFS) at its core is simply a traversal algorithm that attempts to traverse as "deep" as possible before backtracking.

(insert example, disconnected graph, order nodes starting from 1)

time (discover, finish)
color
parent (predecessor subgraph)
